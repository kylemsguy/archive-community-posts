# archive-community-posts
A couple of quick and dirty scripts to help with archiving YouTube community posts (including Members posts)

Hacked together while I'm on vacation because recent events have made scripts like this desirable.

## How to use (TODO: automate the loading of the posts [steps 1-3])
1. Open https://www.youtube.com/@<channel_name>/community
2. Scroll down to the bottom in order to load all of the posts
3. Open up dev console and copy the entire page
4. Save it to a file of your choice (we'll use `community-posts.html` as an example)
5. Run the following command: `python3 extract_post_urls.py community-posts.html -o youryoutubechannelposts.txt` (feel free to change the filenames as you please)
6. Run the following command (omit --cookies if you don't care about members posts): `python3 archive_community_pages.py --cookies youtube.com_cookies.txt youryoutubechannelposts.txt path/to/youtubechannelarchive`

## Caveats/Future plans
- While this does support saving poll data, the poll statistics data will be incomplete if you haven't voted in the poll or aren't logged in (using cookies.txt)
- YouTube never exposes any exact timestamps, so there's no way to get more granularity than "1 week ago" or "1 month ago"
- Currently the data is archived in reverse chronological order starting from 0. In the future I might design a better scheme and a migration script
- In the future I intend to use the data generated by these scripts to generate a more navigable HTML archive
- Videos (including members videos) are NOT saved, but the links are included in the final `extracted_post_data.json`. Use yt-dlp to download these videos.
- Extracting comment data is not implemented, but could be implemented in the future (but isn't a requirement at the moment, so it's not implemented)
- A code cleanup is planned, because this was very much hacked together.

## Bugs
If you run into any issues, please open an issue and include a direct link to the post that it's being errored out on. If it's a members post, please include the `ytinitialdata.json` file in your report (you may send it to me privately somehow)
